I'll take this chance to maybe mention a bit about the architecture and the design of this campus. The land itself is very squarish and beautiful, fronting the river with the mountain in the back with roads on actually on all four sides. So the architect we employ, his name is Robert Holmes. He was a former partner at what the biggest US architecture firm called Skidmore Owens & Merrill. He know quite well the requirement of a big and a true school from the young one all the way to the high school. The general layout is in a round shape, so in Chinese thought also very suiting with the yin-yuan concept of earth and sky in harmony. So I think the design had worked out quite well and I think it will be very suitable as an education center for our children at GIS. So I think this would suit and cater well to all the needs of the GIS students and teachers here.
