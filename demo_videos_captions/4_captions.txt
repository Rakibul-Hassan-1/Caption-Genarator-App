If I choose to stay in a normal, traditional high school, my life will be completely different. NCPA is an international school. It really requires students to step out from their comfort zone. NCPA wants us to negotiate more, collaborate more, plan more and achieve more. So it's NCPA. All these four values are very important in life. I really enjoyed the opportunity that students got to experience the American system of teaching or education. The best thing about this school for me is the MUN program. I started to learn a lot about the UN, how it works. I started to get to know everyone because the MUN has taught me you got to talk with other people, you got to make some friends. My free time, mostly I'll be drawing and reading. I go to the art gallery and continue on my artwork. I like soccer. I played in school competitive teams for the past three years. Every year we travel to other schools and other schools come to NCPA to play with us. What I really like about the school team is team spirit. Other than MUN, I also participate in the student government. Our job is to represent the student body. It's kind of like a bridge to communicate with the headmaster and the student. It's a process of learning how to be a leader, how to be a friend, how to deal with other people. We have a really good counselor. What counselor gave us is pick the school that is best for you, don't just look at the ranking. And pick the best job for you, not just look at the salary. This year I got my black belt. I think I will open a Taekwondo ASA. I'm pretty qualified to lead the club. Those experiences are really helpful for me to prepare for the real world. If I went to another school, maybe I won't be this smiley person right now. I'm still who I am, Gary Su. I just become more competent. I know there will be some sort of magical things happen as I step out of my comfort zone. One day you will be independent. You can't deny this fact. So I hope we will start this early.
